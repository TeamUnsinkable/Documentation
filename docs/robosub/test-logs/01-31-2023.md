description: First offical test of Nautilus Using ROS

Made so we hopefully don't have to make these mistakes again
these notes are rough - only meant to capture important data and are by no means all encompasing

These tests consist of primarly manually sending messages to the `/mavros/rv/overide` topic.
Specific values were sent to specific channels, 1-6, and we observed the results.  

More technical details about how we did this on the computer will (hopefully) come later.

## Forward Movement Tests

### Forward Test 1

> Test : Sending `1750` to channel `5`  

> Expected : Forward movement  

> Result : Success  
> > It moved forward as expected  
> > Killing it was difficult

### Forward Test 2

> Test : Sending `1750` to channel `5`  
> > 50% throttle  

> Expected : Fun  

> Result : Success  
> > It moved as expected at a decently fast pace  
> > Just the forward motors were moving at 100%  

***

## Pitch Movement Tests

### Pitch Test 1

> Test : Sending `1550` to channel `1`  
> > Small incriment  

> Expected : Pitch **down**  

> Result : very small movement (barely noticable)  

### Pitch Test 2

> Test : Sending `1600` to channel `1`  

> Expected : Pitch **down**  

> Result : Fail  
> > The sub's pitch went **up**  
> > The back end went down reasonably  

### Pitch Test 3

> Test : Sending `1300` to channel `1`  

> Expected : Pitch **down**  

> Result : Success  
> > It did pitch down  
> > Face went straight down and did a forward flip  

***

## Roll Movement Tests

### Roll Test 1

> Test : Sending `1700` to channel `2`  

> Expected : Roll **right** (clockwise)  

> Result : Success  
> > Rolled in the right direction as expected  
> > Couldn't completely flip (probably because motor went above water)  

### Roll Test 2

> Test : Sending `1300` to channel `2`

> Expected : Roll **left** (counter-clockwise)

> Result : Success  
> > Rolled in the left direction as expected  
> > Couldn't completely flip (probably because motor went above water)  

***

## Yaw Movement Tests

### Yaw Test 1

> Test : Sending `1600` to channel `4`

> Expected : Yaw clockwise (looking from the top)  
> > or "turn right"  

> Result : Failed  
> > We needed to re-arm it  

### Yaw Test 2

> Test : Sending `1600` to channel `4`
> >  Same as "Yaw Test 1" after re-arming

> Expected : Yaw clockwise (looking from the top)  
> > or "turn right"  

> Result : Success  
> > turned clockwise as expected  
> > **Don't move any faster than `1600`**  

### Yaw Test 3

> Test : Sending `1400` to channel `4`  

> Expected : Yaw counter-clockwise (looking from the top)  
> > or "turn left"  

> Result : Success  
> > Swiftly turned counter clockwise as expected  

***

## Lateral Movement Tests

### Lateral Test 1

> Test : Sending `1550` to channel `6`
> > 15% throttle (was not enough throttle)  

> Expected : It is going to go straight down

> Result : Nothing  
> > Just aft starboard thrusters went on  

### Lateral Test 2

> Test : Sending `1600` to channel `6`  
> > 25% throttle  

> Expected : It is going to go straight down  

> Result : Fail  
> > **It moves to the right** (laterally)  

### Lateral Test 3

> Test : Sending `1400` to channel `6`
> > 25% throttle

> Expected : It is going to move left (laterally)

> Result : Success
> > It moved left as expected

***

## Combination Tests

### Combination Test 1

> Test : Channel `1` and `5` combination  
> > Sending `1550` to channel `1`  
> > Sending `1600` to channel `5`  

> Expected : Pitch down and move forward  

> Result : Fail  
> > It moved forward but not enough push down  

### Combination Test 2

> Test : Channel `1` and `5` combination  
> > Sending `1650` to channel `1`  
> > Sending `1600` to channel `5`  

> Expected : Pitch down and move forward

> Result : Fail  
> > It actually pitched up instead of down  
> > We forgot values above `1500` sent to channel 1 would cause pitch up  

### Combination Test 3

> Test : Channel `1` and `5` combination
> > Sending `1400` to channel `1`  
> > Sending `1600` to channel `5`  

> Expected : Pitch down and move forward

> Result : Fail
> > Moved forward but still no pitch

***

## Manual Control tests

### Control Test 1

> Hooked up joystick to computer
> > Awaiting technical details of how

> Expected : Full manual control using joystick

> Result : Fail

### Control Test 2

> Hooked up xBox to computer
> > Awaiting technical details of how

> Expected : Full manual control using xBox controller

> Result : Fail

***

## Setpoint Velocity Tests

### Setpoint Velocity Test 1

> Test : Tried command `setpointvelocity()` and setting `Z linear` to `1`
> > **using `20 hz` and `setpoint accel 0`**

> Result : Nothing

### Setpoint Velocity Test 2

> Test : Tried command `setpointvelocity()` setting `Z linear` to `1650`
> > **using `20 hz` and `setpoint accel 0`**

> Result : Nothing

### Setpoint Velocity Test 3

> Test : Tried command `setpointvelocity()` and setting **everything** to `1600`
> > **using `20 hz` and `setpoint accel 0`**

> Expected : Nothing

> Result : Nothing (so pass)

### Setpoint Velocity Test 4

> Test : Tried command `setpointvelocity()` and setting **everything** to `1600`
> > **using `100 hz` and `setpoint accel 0`**

> Expected : Something (any movement or action)

> Result : Nothing

## Tests with Connor's Scripts

### Connor Script Test 0 (unofficial)

Connor ran some script (Connor script 0) on ROS that did something

To quote what happened :

> "it rolled to the right and moved to the right"  
> "mainly rolled"

### Connor Script Test 1

> Test : Connor's next updated script on ROS, Connor script 1  

> Result : Nothing

### Connor Script Test 2

> Test : Connor's 2nd updated script on ROS, Connor script 2  

> Result : ***Spin***

To quote what happened :

> "SPINNING!"  
> "went to the right and spun right"

## Other Notable Things

### Gyro Calibration

I was told it was automatic

We took it out of the water and physically rotated the sub to calibrate it.

### Damage

There was a small water leak in the left battery pack, but otherwise no visible melting or damage.

## Key Takeaways

### What We Learned

- E-stop was a good idea
	- However, we need to modify position of e-stops so we don't accidentially shut down everything.
- **Sending `1500` to any channel is stop with manual commands**
	- we can remotely kill the sub by setting channels to `1500`
- Anything sent to channel `1` **above** `1500` is **pitch up**
- Anything sent to channel `1` **below** `1500` is **pitch down**

### Things to Bring Next Time

- Goggles and swimsuit would be good for future
- 100% more towels
- 10 foot rope for e-stop
- Level for calibration
- Battery foam
- Sun shade for laptop

## What We Can Improve

- Improve documentation
- Assign pre-selected positions and create descriptions for these positions
	- captian
	- groundstation
	- divers
	- documenter
	- video person (I can't spell the name)
- Improve communication between divers, captian, and groundstation
- Make calibration printout
- Make a full checklist for everything from vacuming to pool testing
