title: PID and MarcoPolo Test (03-04-2023)

description: Official test of Nautilus, testing for PID with MarcoPolo

## Today's tests
- MarcoPolo inital testing
- PID Initial Testing
  - Roll
  - Pitch
  - Yaw

## General Notes
- E-Stop was self-ejected, need to reprint with a snugger fit.

- When testing all PIDs together they were fighting each other at times, solution would be a full state feedback controller as opposed to a 6 PIDs
 
## Motor Mapping
Initial tests showed that the motors were plugged into the wrong channels. The correct configuration is as follows

(Insert Table)

## Pitch Tests
Initial tests will test communication between all new ROS packages

### Pitch Test 1
Based on code and customized PIDs, there should be some autocorrection

> #### Outcome
> - Overtuned but a success

### Pitch Test 2
Tested following values

    KP = `1000.0`
    KI = `0.0`
    KD = `100.0`

#### Outcome
> - Smoother but can be better

### Pitch Test 3
Tested following values

    KP = `1000.0`
    KI = `20.0`
    KD = `100.0`

#### Outcome
> - Improved steady-state error, but some is still present

### Pitch Test 4
Tested following values

    KP = `1000.0`
    KI = `100.0`
    KD = `100.0`

#### Outcome
> - Steady-state error halved


### Pitch Test 5
Tested following values

    KP = `2000.0`
    KI = `100.0`
    KD = `150.0`

#### Outcome
> - Significant improvement in response time

### Pitch Test 6
Tested following values

    KP = `2000.0`
    KI = `100.0`
    KD = `175.0`

#### Outcome
> - COMPLETE SUCCESS!
> 
***

## Roll Tests
Motors are confirmed working and Pitch controller has been tuned. Some  observations were made and weight distribution should be re-assesed

### Roll Test 1
Tested following values

    KP = `2000.0`
    KI = `100.0`
    KD = `175.0`

#### Outcome
> - Failure, extreme oscillation


### Roll Test 2
Tested following values

    KP = `1000.0`
    KI = `0.0`
    KD = `225.0`

#### Outcome
> - Slow response, but functioning

### Roll Test 3
Tested rolling to a specific angle

    KP = `1000.0`
    KI = `0.0`
    KD = `225.0`

#### Outcome
> - Setpoint changed and sub-maintaed angle
> - Note: Angle is in Radians not degrees

### Roll Test 4
Tested following values

    KP = `1000.0`
    KI = `000.0`
    KD = `225.0`

#### Outcome
> - Oscillation is worse

### Roll Test 5
Tested following values

    KP = `800.0`
    KI = `100.0`
    KD = `250.0`

#### Outcome
> - Better, but still oscillating

### Roll Test 6
Tested following values

    KP = `1000.0`
    KI = `75.0`
    KD = `250.0`

#### Outcome
> - Oscillation worse over time

### Roll Test 7
Tested following values

    KP = `800.0`
    KI = `75.0`
    KD = `400.0`

#### Outcome
> - Oscillation is significantly worse

### Roll Test 8
Tested following values

    KP = `800.0`
    KI = `75.0`
    KD = `400.0`
    WindUp-Limit = `10.0`

#### Outcome
> - Jank

### Roll Test 9
Tested following values

    KP = `800.0`
    KI = `75.0`
    KD = `150.0`
    WindUp-Limit = `50.0`

#### Outcome
> -  Minimal oscillation

### Roll Test 10

## Pitch/Roll Test
We only performed one test with these combined tests with both PIDs for the sake of experimentation. We tested the following values:

    Pitch
    KP = `2000.0`
    KI = `100.0`
    KD = `175.0`

    Roll
    KP = `1100.0`
    KI = `100.0`
    KD = `110.0`

## Final Tests
Unfortunately, all tests performed after this point were not recorded. We went on to successfully test and tune the yaw controller.
