## Preliminary Notes

- Zip tie the depth sensor cable
- Make a checklist of everything we need for tests
- The beeps on the ESC
  - The first three beeps means turned on
  - Low beep is PWM
  - High beep is PWM throttle=0

### Today's Tests

- Depth Hold
- Set point velocity
- Set point local pose
- Custom tim script
- Connor experimentation

### TL;DR

- Depth hold HOTAS worked perfectly
- Tether got stuck in impellers during simple dive
- Override did not take control away from HOTAS
- Front right and rear left motors spin during depth hold, possible calibration issue
- Motors are incorrectly arming/disarming, estop is working fine, possible battery issue
- Add BMS to the PICSOC

## Depth Hold

### Simple dive

- Manually dove to 3ft with hotas manual control
- Tether got stuck in impellers

### Manual control to depth and RC override commands

- Initial hold successful
- RC override forward 1750 PWM unsuccessful
- RC override forward 1700 PWM unsuccessful
- Divers have noticed front right and rear left motors are constantly spinning when armed in depth hold, possible calibration issue

## Set Point Velocity

Insufficient time

## Set Point Local Pose

Insufficient time

## Custom Tim Script

Insufficient time

## Connor Experimentation

- Set mode to stabilize
- First two attempts ineffective
- Unsuccessful
