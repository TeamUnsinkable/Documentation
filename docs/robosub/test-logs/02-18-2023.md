## Today's Tests

- PID Test for Pitch Accuracy
- Sonar Tests

## PID Test for pitch accuracy

- set to 0
- rc override was publishing, nothing happened

### Manual Pitch

- Bot not moving, despite manual publication
- ESC not beeping
- Manual control with HOTAS functioning properly
- "ROS may be the problem" - Tim
- PID's are doing things correctly as far as we can tell, but MAVROS isn't receiving anything

### RC Override Forwards

- No movement
- HOTAS still works

## Sonar Test

- It can see walls at 2m range
- At 5m, we can see some objects
- We can see the buoy!

### Gate Test

- gate will be near surface for competition
- the gate fell apart upon insertion in water, the duct tape didn't hold
- TODO: get pvc cement

## MAVROS Worked Eventually

- Set GCS ID to 1 in the apm.launch
- Allowed RC override on NUC
- Disabled HOTAS
- Worked once on Tim's computer, but it didn't work on the launch file, more testing is necessary
