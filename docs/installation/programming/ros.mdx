## What is ROS?
ROS can be though of as a communication layer for any and all components of any robot. Multiple computers in the network can join this network as long as they are connected to the same LAN (Local Area Netowork), 
in our case we use a router that broadcasts the `AMRA Ground Station` and `AMRA Ground Station 5G` networks. Without getting too technical here's a birds eye view of how ROS works.
